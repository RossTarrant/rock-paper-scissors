# Rock Paper Scissors

The task for this project was to recreate the game of Rock Paper Scissors using a JavaScript script. The project has been further extended to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create a graphical user interface for the game.

From having an understanding of Python previously, this challenge was relatively straight forward and did not take long to complete. I spent a lot of my time practicing the syntax of JavaScript as it is quite different to that of Python, although the key concepts are consistent.

Next steps are to add a graphical interface to the project, rather than just relying on alerts/prompts that exist in the current implementation.

**SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT:**

_**Some of the things I have learned from completing this project:**_

- Javascript functions work very similar to that of Python, which I have studied before. However, there are more interesting and exciting features of Javascript functions that I am looking forward to trying in the future such as: **_arrow functions, function expressions and function callbacks_**.

- TBC Graphical user interface design (using flexbox)

- TBC Graphical user interface implementation (using JS+DOM)

_**Some of the challenges I faced during this project:**_

- Adapting to the differences between Python and Javascript. Having spent a lot of my programming experience using Python, I have had to learn a lot of new syntax and functionality that comes with Javascript.

- Creating a random number using the Math.random function produced some unexpected outputs (e.g. outputting floats rather than integers), I soon rectified this using Math.floor.
