# rock-paper-scissors

The task for this project was to recreate the game of Rock Paper Scissors using JavaScript scripts.

From having an understanding of Python previously, this challenge was relatively straight forward and did not take long to complete. I spent a lot of my time practicing the syntax of JavaScript as it is quite different to that of Python, although the key concepts are consistent.

Next steps are to add a graphical interface to the project, rather than just relying on alerts/prompts.
