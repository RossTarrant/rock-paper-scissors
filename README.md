# Rock Paper Scissors

**PROJECT SUMMARY:**

The task for this project was to recreate the game of Rock Paper Scissors using a JavaScript script. The project has been further extended to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create a graphical user interface for the game.

From having an understanding of Python previously, this challenge was relatively straight forward and did not take long to complete. I spent a lot of my time practicing the syntax of JavaScript as it is quite different to that of Python, although the key concepts are consistent.

Next steps are to add a graphical interface to the project, rather than just relying on alerts/prompts that exist in the current implementation.

_**Some of the things I have learned from completing this project:**_

- Javascript functions work very similar to that of Python, which I have studied before. However, there are more interesting and exciting features of Javascript functions that I am looking forward to trying in the future such as: **_arrow functions, function expressions and function callbacks_**.

- From previous projects, I was instantly able to set up the interface in the way I had in mind thanks to flexbox. I also was able to import a custom font that I downloaded from Google.

- I have developed a good understanding on how JavaScript can be used to dynamically add, remove and edit HTML elements on the page. I can see many ways this can be useful for future projects and am starting to understand how many websites I currently use might use these methods to add/change content on the webpage.

- I have learned a lot about event listeners and how they can be attached to an HTML element to listen for various events such as clicks, hovers etc.

_**Some of the challenges I faced during this project:**_

- Adapting to the differences between Python and Javascript. Having spent a lot of my programming experience using Python, I have had to learn a lot of new syntax and functionality that comes with Javascript.

- Creating a random number using the Math.random function produced some unexpected outputs (e.g. outputting floats rather than integers), I soon rectified this using Math.floor.

- Understanding the behaviours of event listeners and query selectors and incorporating them into my code. 

_**If I was to spend more time on this project I would:**_

- Attempt to solve the issue where the previous text that has been updated does not seem to disappear, or at least that seems to be what the problem is.

- Extend the app further to add extra functionality such as a reset button, multiplayer or further game modes.
